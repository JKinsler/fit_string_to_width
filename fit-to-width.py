"""
Write a function that prints a string, fitting its characters within char
limit.

It should take in a string and a character limit (as an integer). It should
print the contents of the string without going over the character limit
and without breaking words. For example:

>>> fit_to_width('hi there', 50)
hi there

Spaces count as characters, but you do not need to include trailing whitespace
in your output:

>>> fit_to_width('Hello, world! I love Python and Hackbright', 10)
...
Hello,
world! I
love
Python and
Hackbright

Your test input will never include a character limit that is smaller than
the longest continuous sequence of non-whitespace characters:

>>> fit_to_width('one two three', 8)
one two
three
